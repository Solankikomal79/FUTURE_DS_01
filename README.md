🔍 Data Insights (Based on Visuals)
Top Performing Region: The West Region is the clear leader in sales volume, significantly outperforming the South region.

Category Distribution: Sales are remarkably well-balanced across categories. Technology leads slightly at 36.4% of revenue, followed by Furniture (32.3%) and Office Supplies (31.3%).

Product MVP: The Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier is the highest-grossing individual product, driving over $60K in sales alone.

💡 Business Recommendations
Regional Strategy: Investigate the success factors in the West (e.g., local marketing or logistics) and replicate those strategies in the South to bridge the revenue gap.

Inventory Management: Given that Technology is the highest revenue driver, ensure stock levels for top-tier items like the Canon Copiers are prioritized to avoid "Out of Stock" scenarios.

Profitability Focus: While revenue is balanced across categories, a deeper dive into "Profit by Category" is recommended to see if the high-volume Furniture sales are generating as much margin as Technology.
